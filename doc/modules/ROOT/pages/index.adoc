= Boost.WS.Proto

Boost.WS.Proto is a portable C++ library which provides containers and
algorithms which implement the HTTP/1.1 protocol, widely used to deliver content
on the Internet. It adheres strictly to the HTTP/1.1 RFC specification
(henceforth referred to as https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110[rfc9110,window=blank_]).

This library understands the grammars related to HTTP nessages and provides
functionality to validate, parse, examine, and modify messages.

== Features

== Requirements

The library requires a compiler supporting at least C++11.

Standard types such as `error_code` or `string_view` use their Boost equivalents.

== Tested Compilers

Boost.WS.Proto has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang:
* gcc:
* msvc:

and these architectures: x86, x64

We do not test and support gcc 8.0.1.

== Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io and GitHub Actions
* Regular code audits for security

== ABNF

This documentation uses the Augmented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[Backus-Naur Form,window=blank_]
(ABNF) notation of
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234[rfc5234,window=blank_]
to specify particular grammars used by algorithms and containers.
While a complete understanding of the notation is not a requirement for using the
library, it may help for an understanding of how valid components of URLs are defined.
In particular, this is of interest to users who wish to compose parsing algorithms
using the combinators provided by the library.

== Acknowledgments

This library wouldn't be where it is today without the help of
https://github.com/pdimov[Peter Dimov,window=blank_]
for design advice and general assistance.

== Design

=== Comparison to Boost.Beast

This library builds on the experiences learned from Boost.Beast's seven years
of success. Beast brings these unique design strengths:

* Body type named requirements
* First-class message container
* Individual parser and serializer objects

The message container suffers from these problems:

* Templated on the body type.
* Templated on Allocator
* Node-based implementation
* Serialization is too costly

Meanwhile parsers and serializes suffer from these problems:

* Buffer-at-a-time operation is clumsy.
* Objects are not easily re-used
* Parser is a class template because of body types

==== Message Container

In HTTP.Proto the message container implementation always stores the complete
message or fields in its correctly serialized form. Insertions and modifications
are performed in linear time. When the container is reused, the amortized cost
of reallocation becomes zero. A small lookup table is stored past the end of
the serialized message, permitting iteration in constant time.

==== Parser

The HTTP.Proto parser is designed to persist for the lifetime of the connection
or application. It allocates a fixed size memory buffer upon construction and
uses this memory region to perform type-erasure and apply or remove content
encodings to the body. The parser is a regular class instead of a class
template, which greatly improves its ease of use over the Beast parser design.

==== Serializer

As with the parser, the serializer is designed to persist for the lifetime of
the connection or application and also allocates a fixed size buffer.
